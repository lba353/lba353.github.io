        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I want to give you a bit of background about me. I was born on July 5, 2000 and raised in Pasadena, California 
            where I live with my parents as well as my younger sister. My parents immigrated to the United States 
            from Armenia with their brothers, sisters, and cousins and started life anew here. Most of my family now 
            resides in California, making me and my cousins all first-generation Armenian Americans here in the US. 
            Within my family, I was also a first-generation college student, graduating from UCSD in 2024 
            with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.

                            When the COVID-19 pandemic started, they hired me back to make some minor changes and flexibility regarding

                            and being able to bring it to a larger and more professional setting. I was in charge of running events 
                            and making sure everything was running smoothly, working with a much larger team and with more tools
                            then I was working back at No Future Cafe.
